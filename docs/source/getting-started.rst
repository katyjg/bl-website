Getting Started
===============

A test deployment using docker-compose is included with this website code.
To use it, extract ``deploy/skel.tar.gz`` in a directory of your choice.

Dependencies
------------
 - Docker Engine 1.13.0+
 - Docker Compose

Testing Your Deployment
-----------------------
 1. Extract ``deploy/skel.tar.gz`` in a directory of your choice
 2. Verify that the ``hostname`` and ``SERVER_NAME`` are correct in docker-compose.yml
 3. ``docker-compose pull``
 4. ``docker-compose up -d``

     - a new postgresql database is created in ``./database/``,
     - self-signed SSL certificates are created in ``./certs/``,
     - a file `.db-init` is created in ``./app-local/``
 5. ``./test-site.sh <BEAMLINE_NAME>``

     - follow prompts to create an administrator account
     - a basic set of web pages are created for testing
 6. Find your new test website at https://{SERVER_NAME}
 7. Sign in with your new administrator account at https://{SERVER_NAME}/admin
