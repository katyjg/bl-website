Quick Start
===========

A test deployment using docker-compose is included with this website code.
To use it, extract deploy/skel.tar.gz in a directory of your choice.

**Dependences:** 
 - Docker Engine 1.13.0+
 - Docker Compose
 
**Testing:**
 1. Extract deploy/skel.tar.gz in a directory of your choice
 2. Verify that the `hostname` and `SERVER_NAME` are correct in docker-compose.yml
 3. `docker-compose pull` 
 4. `docker-compose up -d` 
     - a new postgresql database is created in `./database/`, 
     - self-signed SSL certificates are created in `./certs/`,
     - a file `.db-init` is created in `./app-local/`
 5. `./test-site.sh <BEAMLINE_NAME>`
     - follow prompts to create an administrator account
     - a basic set of web pages are created for testing
 6. Find your new test website at https://<SERVER_NAME>
 7. Sign in with your new administrator account at https://<SERVER_NAME>/admin
